# ReactStyling-JSX

This is all about React application styling in both ways 
      1. using CSS stylesheet style
      2. inline styling
      
 1. CSS stylesheet is creted for heading and it is added to h1 tag with "className" in index.js.
 
 2. This styling includes Javascript object creation earlier and then that object is added in  " <h1 style = {customStyle} ></h1> " .
    To fetch object property and make changes - eg: customStyle.color
    Here customStyle is Javascript object created.
